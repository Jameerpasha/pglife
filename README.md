## PG Life Web Application

PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application that I developed as part of my Internshala Web Development Internship Training. Throughout the project, I received valuable guidance and support from my trainer, which allowed me to apply my own understanding and knowledge to create this web application. I prioritized a user-centric approach and customized the functionalities to optimize the overall user experience. This project serves as a testament to my skills as a web developer, highlighting my proficiency in creating a robust and user-friendly web application.

The web application is fully responsive, allowing users to access and utilize all its features seamlessly from any device.
